# IceAge

IceAge is a [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) client written specifically (and only) for Windows using WinUI3. IceAge is currently in the early stages of development.

### What is Working?

-   Ability to login and authorize the application.
-   Ability to see a limited timeline.

## Building & Requirements

I have only tested building on Windows 11 x64 using Visual Studio 2019.
